# Website Deployment

## Introduction

Welcome to the Website Deployment repository! This project is a complete, automated solution for deploying a website using CI/CD pipelines, Docker containers, and Ansible for machine provisioning. The deployment process includes data ingestion, database recovery, NGINX server setup, and SSL certification via Certbot. All dependencies are managed seamlessly within Docker containers, making this deployment process efficient, scalable, and maintainable.

## Features

- **Automated Machine Provisioning:** Ansible is used to provision the machine, ensuring that all required packages and configurations are in place.
- **Dockerized Environment:** All components of the website, including the web server, database, and application, are containerized, ensuring consistency across different environments.
- **CI/CD Pipeline:** Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment are set up to automate the build, test, and deployment processes.
- **Data Ingestion and Recovery:** The system can ingest data and run a recovery process for the database as part of the deployment.
- **NGINX Web Server:** NGINX is used as the web server, configured to serve the application and handle SSL termination.
- **SSL Certification:** Certbot is used to automatically obtain and renew SSL certificates, ensuring secure HTTPS connections.

## Prerequisites

Before starting the deployment, ensure that you have the following:

- Ansible installed on the provisioning machine.
- A domain name configured and pointing to your server's IP address, in the Ec2 instance.

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Provision the Machine

Use Ansible to provision the machine and install the required system packages. This includes Docker, Docker Compose, NGINX, and Certbot.

```yaml
- name: Provision the machine
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Update apt package index
      apt:
        update_cache: yes

    - name: Upgrade all packages to the latest version
      apt:
        upgrade: dist

    - name: Install required system packages
      apt:
        pkg:
          - python3-pip
          - virtualenv
          - python3-setuptools
          - docker-buildx-plugin
          - docker-compose-plugin
          - nginx
        state: latest
        update_cache: yes
```

### 2. Configure Docker

Set up Docker containers for the web application, database, and any other required services. Ensure that all dependencies are handled within the containers.

### 3. Run the Deployment

Deploy the website using the provided CI/CD pipeline. The pipeline will:

- Build and test the Docker images.
- Deploy the containers to the target machine.
- Ingest the necessary data and run the recovery process for the database.
- Spin up NGINX and configure it to serve the application.
- Obtain and configure SSL certificates using Certbot.

### 4. Monitor and Maintain

After deployment, monitor the application to ensure everything is running smoothly. Certbot will automatically renew SSL certificates as needed.

## Conclusion

This deployment process represents a significant leap forward in automating and streamlining website deployment. By leveraging Ansible, Docker, and CI/CD practices, we ensure that the deployment is not only automated but also reproducible and scalable. All dependencies are managed within Docker containers, eliminating environment-specific issues and making the entire process self-contained.
